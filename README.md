# ML1
Machine Learning to predict email contacts <br />
This is my improved version of what was a term-project with a group of 4 in a ML class <br />

1) cleaner.py = cleans the strings with stop/stem words, universal strings, and punctuations(finished) and outputs the cleaned indexed file. <br />
   // Do NOT need to run again if HRC_clean.tsv is in ./data/ <br />
2) data_explorers.py = code for myself to explore the data and identify patterns <br />
3) data_explorers.ipiynb = same as data_explorers.py, but for Jupyter notebook. <br />
**Improved versions of SVM, RF, and K-means algorithms coming soon!**
